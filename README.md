Hello World repository
This is a file that has been edited to demonstrate commits in github. There is nothing about me in here. Absolutely nothing. I repeat, nothing.  Ok, maybe a little. Well, if historians were to look at this file and 'mine' it for data, they would probably say that I was awfully nice but beyond that there would be nothing about me. That's it. Go away now. Nothing to see here. Move along.  Ok, maybe that I occasionally double space after a period but beyond that there's nothing, I swear.
